# Furniture-Auction

## Project Description

We seek to create a platform where users, consisting of buyers and sellers, can place bids and sell furniture in digital auctions. Sellers will be able to list their furniture items for auction. Buyers will be able to sort and navigate the site to find their desired furniture, and place a bid on them. The buyer with the highest bid can then purchase the item. Payments and shipments will be processed accordingly. The buyer and the seller can then review and rate each other once their purchase has been fully processed. The system will also support other functionalities such as a “liked” list, as listed in detail below.
